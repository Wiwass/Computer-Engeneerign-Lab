Exercise 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations
Write a C program that does the following:

Declares two integer variables, a and b, and initializes them with values of your choice.
Calculates and prints the sum, difference, product, and quotient of a and b.

Exercise 2: Modulus Operation
Write a C program that calculates and prints the remainder of a divided by b using the modulus operator.

Exercise 3: Compound Assignment
Write a C program that demonstrates the use of compound assignment operators (e.g., +=, -=) to update the values of variables a and b. Increase a by 3 and decrease b by 2 using compound assignment operators, and then print the updated values.

Exercise 4: Precedence and Parentheses
Write a C program that demonstrates the importance of operator precedence and the use of parentheses. Calculate and print the result of the following expression: 2 * (5 + 3) / 4 without parentheses too.

Exercise 5: Currency Conversion

Write a C program that performs currency conversion from US Dollars (USD) to Euros (EUR) and British Pounds (GBP). The program should:

considering the amounts 1,..,10 USD calculate the equivalent amounts in EUR and GBP using the following exchange rates:
1 USD = 0.91 EUR
1 USD = 0.76 GBP
Display a table with the amounts in USD and the converted amounts in EUR and GBP.
